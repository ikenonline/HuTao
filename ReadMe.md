## Commands
The bot command prefix is `ht!`, but also supports slash-commands. Help for a specific command can be retrieved via `ht!help <command>`. Syntax for these commands might be slightly different due to limitations of Discord, you can see the usage for those commands by typing `/` in a chat with the bot. For example typing `/char` will show the commands that start with `char` like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vEf0IGD.png). Most commands support [autocomplete](https://i.imgur.com/PeecLQm.png) when using the slash command version.

Every reply to commands will include an ❌ delete button, users can click this button to remove the bot post. This allows users to clean up in case something wasn't relevant to the conversation/reduce spam.

To improve usability, most commands that search stuff are fuzzy search and provide autocomplete in slash version when applicable. This means you can make a typo, or shorten the heck out of their names. (As of time of writing, `glad` matches `Gladiator's Finale`, `CW` matches `Crimson Witch of Flames`, `amus` matches `Amos' Bow`)
